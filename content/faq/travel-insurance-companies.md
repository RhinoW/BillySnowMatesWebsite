## Premium Bank Account and inclusive travel insurance

Check your T&C's that it covers winter-sports, what you will be doing (off piste?) and for how long.

## MPI Brokers - [https://www.mpibrokers.com](https://www.mpibrokers.com)

Including Seasonaire and long stay.

## ERV - [https://www.erv.co.uk/](https://www.erv.co.uk/)

## Ski Cover - [https://www.skicover.com/](https://www.skicover.com/)

[10% BSM Discont](/discounts/) but beware different polices have VERY different T&C wording so you can't compare just by looking at the Benefits/Excess table. (e.g. Voyager Ski will cover off piste without a guide as standard, for the others it's an upgrade which significatnly bumps up the cost.)

## Ski Club - [https://www.skiclubinsurance.co.uk/](https://www.skiclubinsurance.co.uk/)

15% Discount for Ski club GB members but beware of the recent negative press of the company behind this scheme (Travel Insurance Facilities / TIF) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46274918](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46274918)

## Insure and Go - [https://www.insureandgo.com/](https://www.insureandgo.com/)

Don't think they cover the return journey.

## DogTag - [https://www.dogtag.co.uk/](https://www.dogtag.co.uk/)

Can be expensive and don't think they cover the return journey.

## Snowcard - [https://www.snowcard.co.uk/](https://www.snowcard.co.uk/)

## Alpine / Mountaineering organisations

* British Mountaineering club (BMC)
