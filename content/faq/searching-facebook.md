So you’ve got a question? Great! But first please take a few minutes as it’s likely the exact same question has been asked before. Maybe a dozen times. If it’s a hot topic, maybe a dozen times in the last week!

## 1. Check the FAQ

Thats right [here!](/faq/)

## 2. Try the Search feature

It's not always great - but is worth a try. It's in a slightly different place on different devices and can change but you’re looking for **“Search This Group”**

If you’re on PC/Mac then scroll to the top of the page :-

If you’re on the Facebook App for Android or iOS (iPad / iPhone) then it’s always at the top of the screen (unless commenting) :-
