We have regular meets at all the uk snow and dry slope venues as well as running lots of trips to the mountains to suit all budgets and abilities.

We generally have one or two big trips per year (the infamous **Billy Bash**) and with nearly a hundred people taking part they are a great way for new members to meet lots of people.

There are also many smaller trips and events - often setup by members themselves acting as 'hosts'.

We are a non-profit group that means that all our trips, events and merchandise are run at cost with no one getting a free space, not even the event host.

Worried that you don't know anyone?

There are a lot of first timers on each trip. In 2018 we had 73 people and only 16 had been on one of the trips before, so most people are solo and first timers.

For people who don't know many others we suggest bunches of people who might like to ride together - similar skills and interests. There are no silly games involved (Hi Di Hi!) and of course you're not limited or forced to stay with those folks but it does give everyone a good start.

There are no cliques and everyone is friendly and welcoming. We put you in accommodation with same sex and similar age groups.

There is plenty of chance to get to know people before hand either on-online or at one of the dome meetups and there are always people to ride with at your riding level and style.

Its how Billy Snow Mates started after all - take the plunge!

{{< div-card-width-6 "Skill Level & Interest">}}

**Not a park-rat?** No problem - some people like to cruise.
**Like your beer?** No problem - some people use their ski/snowboard to commute from one bar to the next, just warming up for the Apres.
**Like to charge from first lift to last** - yup we've got that covered too.

{{< div-card-width-6 "Can't afford it or don't link cheap and cheerful">}}
Sometimes we have a range of accommodation options - Cheap Billies and Posh Billies - but if you don't like the look of the accommodation we've organized you're welcome of course to book your own for the same time and come hang out with us.

{{< div-card-width-6 "What do they include">}}
Generally its just accommodation. Sometimes food (or an option for that) - depends on the resort and accommodation.

You have to organize travel / transfers (though we sometimes arrange shared transfers) insurance and lift pass etc. There is plenty of help and advice though.

{{< div-card-width-6 "Is this just for snowboarders?">}}
Most of us are snowboarders, its just the way the group has grown. Its open to everyone though, there are some skiers and some of us swing both ways too.

If you've got snow blades we can help you with that too. Might hurt a bit though...
