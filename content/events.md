We have regular meets at all the uk snow and dry slope venues as well as running lots of trips to the mountains to suit all budgets and abilities.

We generally have one or two big trips per year (the infamous **Billy Bash**) and with nearly a hundred people taking part they are a great way for new members to meet lots of people.

There are also many smaller trips and events - often setup by members themselves acting as 'hosts'.

We are a non-profit group that means that all our trips, events and merchandise are run at cost with no one getting a free space, not even the event host.
